# ATmega32_Drivers
This repository contains drivers for the ATmega32 microcontroller family. The drivers are written in C.

## Introduction
The ATmega32 microcontroller family is a popular choice for embedded applications. It offers a wide range of features, including a 8-bit AVR processor.

The drivers in this repository provide a high-level interface to the peripherals on the ATmega32 microcontrollers. They make it easy to access the GPIO pins, timers, ADC, I2C, SPI, and USART peripherals.
